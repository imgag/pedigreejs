# pedigreejs

This version of pedigreejs is a webtool build with the javascript module of
the [Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology - BOADICEA group](https://ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/boadicea/). The original module can be found on the [project page](https://ccge-boadicea.github.io/pedigreejs/).
This webtool is meant to support two usecases:

1. Draw a pedigree and export it in the correct file format for the [CanRisk](https://canrisk.org/) cancer risk prediction.
2. Draw a pedigree with a user-defined set of diseases

The user can define her/his own pehontype set at the beginning of a new pedigree or afterwards if something changed.
This configuration features autocomplete for a predefined set of HPO terms.

## For Users

The pedigree features three areas, the menu, the pedigree area and the family member configuration.

### Menu

General Functions:<br/>
*New* - Deletes the current disease configuration and pedigree to start a new one<br/>
*Load* - Loads a previously saved pedigree or a pedigree in the BOADICEA file format<br/>
*Save* - Saves the current pedigree and all actively occuring diseases in the JSON file format<br/>
Configuration:<br/>
*Configure Diseases* - Opens a configuration window that allows the user to define her/his own set of dieseases/phenotypes. The input field features an autocomplete for a set of predefined HPO terms.<br/>
Export in different file formats:<br/>
*Export BOADICEA* - Exports the current pedigree in the BOADICEA format for the CanRisk cancer prediction. This requires that all sexes and a proband is defined.<br/>
*Print* - Opens a print dialog for the current pedigree<br/>
*SVG* - Exports the current pedigree in as svg<br/>
*PNG* - Exports the currently visible part of the pedigree as PNG picture<br/>

### Pedigree

The pedigree is able to show all common family histories. On hover six different symbols might appear:

1. *Arrow up* - Add parents. Only for parentless individuals. Both parents will be added to the pedigree and two configuration windows will pop up, one for each parent
2. *Arrow down* - Add child. Only for parents. A child gets added to the relationship and a configuration window will pop up. If twins are selected two configuration windows will pop up.
3. *Arrow right* - Add sibling. Only for children. Like 'Add child' a child gets added to the relationship and a configuration window will pop up.
4. *Chains* - Add partner. Only for individuals with up to one partner. Adds a partner and a child to the pedigree.
5. *X* - Delete. Deletes the individual of the pedigree.
6. *â– * - Consanguity. Two individuals can be connected as consangious partners if somewhere in the pedigree the derive form the same relationship.

### Individual configuration

This window shows the name of the currently added individual in the top left corner. There are four distinct sections:<br/>
*General Info* - Information about the individual, like age, year of birth, sex, etc.<br/>
*Age of Diagnosis* - Information about the age of diagnosis of the diseases/phenotypes.<br/>
*Genetic Tests* - A list of genetic tests required for the export to the BOADICEA format. The test can be a mutation search or a genetic gene test.<br/>
*Pathology Tests* - A list of test about the pathology of certain conditions being pathologic.<br/>
